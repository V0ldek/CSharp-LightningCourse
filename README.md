# CSharp-LightningCourse

C# lightning course (in Polish) as a .NET Interactive Notebook.

Plus some code snippets to put it into action.

## Usage:

Open the repo folder in VS Code and install the [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension.

### Snippets

To run snippet `X` run:

```
dotnet run --project X
```

For example:

```
dotnet run --project Classes
```

Note: `NotebookUtils` contains no snippets, it's a CLI utility I hacked together to generate
Table of Contents with working links in the Notebook.
